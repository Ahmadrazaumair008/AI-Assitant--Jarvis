👋 Hey there! Meet **Al-Assistant-Jarvis** 🤖

This is a Python-powered voice assistant that listens to your commands and tries its best to help! It can do a few cool things right now:

✨ **What Jarvis Can Do:** ✨

* 🌐 **Open Websites:** Just ask to open Google, Facebook, YouTube, and more!
* 🎶 **Play Music:** If you have a `musiclibrary.py` with your songs linked, Jarvis can play them for you. Just say "play [song name]".
* 🧠 **Chat with AI:** For anything else, Jarvis uses the power of Gemini to try and answer your questions and follow your instructions!

🛠️ **Getting Started (Quick & Easy!)** 🛠️

1.  **Make sure you have Python installed.**
2.  **Install the needed helpers:** Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
    ```bash
    pip install pyaudio SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 gTTS google-generativeai pygame
    ```
3.  **Grab the code:** Download or clone this repository.
4.  **Get your Gemini API Key:** You'll need an API key from Google AI Studio ([https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)). **Add `"Your own API Key"` in `main.py` with your actual key!**
5.  **Set up your music library:** Create a `musiclibrary.py` file in the same directory. It should be a Python dictionary where the keys are song names and the values are the URLs to play them (e.g., YouTube links).
6.  **Run Jarvis!** Open your terminal in the project directory and type:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
7.  **Talk to Jarvis!** Say "Jarvis" to wake him up, and then tell him what you'd like him to do.
